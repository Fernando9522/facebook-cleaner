# FUZZIFY ME

*A work in progress*

A browser extension that helps you understand how advertisers target you on Facebook. With one click, the tool automatically runs a housecleaning, denying advertisers access to all the categories Facebook is constantly generating about you. In the timeline to the right, you can keep track of what categories have been cleared out and what targeted ads you're seeing over time.

Built for both Chrome & Firefox.

## How to use it

Instruction are for Chrome, but steps are similar in Firefox

1. Clone this github repository or download it as a zip file and unzip: https://github.com/d4t4x/facebook-cleaner
2. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/` and click `"Load Unpacked"`. Then you'll want to pick the "build" folder from the project folder.
3. If you have an ad blocker, you'll need to disable it while you browse Facebook.
4. Click the purple icon in the toolbar and you'll see the full visual timeline of all the ads & cleaning history. It will take a few days to collect enough data, so at first this will appear empty.
