# FAQ

## Why is it not working?
- First of all, breathe, if your internet connection is not the fastest, it might take a few seconds for the extension to start. This is because it always waits for Facebook to load all of their content first.
- It doesn't work with an Ad Blocker enabled on Facebook.com.
- Is doesn't work in a Private/Incognito window.

## What other limitations are there?
A request for the rationale of "Why am I seeing this ad" starts after a few seconds and then only gets called every 30 seconds to avoid getting blocked.

## I still have questions how do I contact you?
