# Privacy Policy

Our users’ privacy is important to us and we really mean that. It is Fuzzify.me's policy to respect users’ privacy regarding our Chrome browser extension & Firefox add-on.

#### Personal Data

The permissions that the extension asks for is local data processing and storage, which means that all the data remains on your machine. The extension does not collect or send information to external servers. In other words, we [the makers of this extension] do not collect any personal information. We don’t share any personal user information publicly or with third-parties.

#### Relationship to Facebook

Fuzzify.me provides Facebook users with (1) a tool to customize their ad preferences page on Facebook; and (2) A snapshot of what advertisements users are seeing over time on their Facebook newsfeed (Ads Stream).

Fuzzify.me is not using Facebook’s API to provide the above mentioned features. The extension looks at the rendered front-end of the user’s Facebook page in the browser, the DOM, which is made up of HTML elements and their content. With JavaScript, the browser extension (1) clicks to remove the preferences (on facebook.com/ads/preferences) that the user chose and (2) collects information about the user’s Facebook page/newsfeed and saves that information locally on their computer only.

In the Ads Stream the extension also shows the information Facebook provides about why users are seeing the advertisements. In order to capture this for the user the extension clicks on the menu item in the drop down menu of the sponsored posts and sends a request on the user’s behalf to receive this information.

#### Policy Changes

There is a possibility that this Privacy Policy will be adapted in the future, to clarify or modify it in response to feature changes or user feedback. You can check the privacy policy for changes. You can refer to the Last updated timestamp at the bottom of the page.
